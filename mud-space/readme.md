- hire a crew

## Galaxy

Galaxy is like a big sphere, where start systems can jump anywhere in the borders. Player can stay in the border systems
that have low probability to find someone else. Or they can jump in direction of the center, that giving th amount
of systems decrease, bigger chance to find other players.

In direction of the center, more dangerous, and more rewards.

## Start systems

Each player start into a unique start system outside of may galaxy. Only player knows its coordinates, others can only 
go there if he shares it. When your system coord are shared, now way to block access (maybe cyno jammers)
